## Conceit
You are lost in the labyrinth that is a poorly organized file folder directory. Using basic command line commands, navigate your way to the `exit.exe`.

## To-do:
- css to have `<input>` box w/blinking cursor, text wraparound
    - `<div>` above it to show latest command and its output
- Black background, and `rgb(0, 255, 0)` colored text
- Three commands
    - `ls`
    - `run`
    - `cd`
    - possibility of saving variables as "inventory"
-
